# LogViewer2

This is a prototype of a log file viewer.
It is intended to show only the mostinteresting information in a log, in a table view.
Currently it can parse a log that is read from a file, using a fixed parser.

This version is a prototype. Everything is hard coded, and the code structure is horrible.
Opening a file from a http server does not work, filtering does not work.
